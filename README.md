# Hanime

A simple Python-based library designed to seamlessly interact with the **Hanime** API.

## Todo

- [ ] Add more `user` related features.
- [ ] Improve documentation (provide more in-depth information with better examples).
- [ ] Implement video downloading/scraping (requires solving captcha; refer to the documentation (`notes`) for more information on the captcha used and how to bypass it).

## Author Note

I created this library out of sheer boredom. While it's not my top priority, I won't abandon the project. If there are issues that need fixing, I'll address them. I'll also work on new features if the need arises. Contributions are welcome through issues or pull requests.

Feel free to contact me for any queries or contributions.
